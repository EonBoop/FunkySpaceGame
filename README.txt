FUNKY SPACE GAME PEW PEW PEW

My personal objectives
  learn c++
  impliment algorithms
  LITTLE SPACE SHIP GOES FAST
  vibe with buddies

We're using the Raylib library in C++ because I'm a masochist

RoadMap

Player Object
  Animated lil spaceship
  Goes fast
  Boost, shoot stuff
  Collision
    Directional bounce
    Hit something too hard and explode
  Eventually have something that show's where the ship will go?

NPC Objects
  Entities that exert gravity
  Entities that try and stop the player

Map making
  Load objects from a text file with position, velocity, and image
  Move stuff around in an editor mode
  save current position and velocity files to a text file


Things that are actively annoying me 
  Currently have files listed from my OS root directory instead of the programs root director
